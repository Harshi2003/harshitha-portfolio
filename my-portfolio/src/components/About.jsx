      <p>
        Hello! I&apos;m Harshitha — someone who loves turning ideas into intelligent
        systems that can see, hear, understand, and make everyday experiences
        smarter and more meaningful. My fascination with AI didn’t begin with research
        papers or advanced models — it started with simple curiosity. I was always the person
        who wondered how apps recognized faces, how recommendations worked, or how a few lines
        of logic could create something magical. That curiosity eventually pulled me deep into
        the world of machine learning and computer vision.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at San José
        State University, where I’ve had the opportunity to work across research
        labs, startups, and engineering teams. I’ve built projects ranging from
        emotion-recognition systems to real-world safety tools and full-stack AI
        applications. I love designing solutions that not only work well, but feel
        thoughtful, accessible, and genuinely helpful to the people using them.
      </p>

        Recently, my work has been focused on blending deep learning with
        real-world usability — from AI-powered nutrition tools to computer-vision
        alerts and NLP models that improve digital interactions. I enjoy taking
        messy datasets, complex algorithms, and abstract ideas, and shaping them
        into clean, human-centered experiences.
      </p>

        Outside of research and engineering, you’ll probably find me exploring
        new cafés, going on spontaneous trips, binge-listening to music, or
        laughing endlessly with friends. I love learning new things — whether it&apos;s
        a new tool, a model architecture, or just a fun fact I’ll absolutely share
        later.
